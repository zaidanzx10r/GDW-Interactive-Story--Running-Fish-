# Intro to Computer Graphics Assignment 1

Given that we wanted to use this assignment to further develop our skills and resources for our GDW game we decided to use the same models and codebase we had created for the GDW game so that we could see how the graphics looked in context.

Nicholas Murray and Joseph Chahine are the two students working on the assignment itself and the implementation of all shaders, lighting, color grading, models, textures and movement/look scripts. 
Another student, Zaidan Van Graan, contributed to the movement script by adding audio for the footprints. He also contributed to the scripting for the Win/Lose condition which allows the player to enter a door and either win or lose the game and the menu. He did not contribute in any way to any of the graphical implementations added to the game scene. 

# Color Grading - Nicholas
I decided to play around with different ways to implement color grading. I had little success using the LUT tables and the code provided during lectures. I had modified the code to allow for the LUT 'contribution' slider to be accessible directly in the camera's inspector rather than having to change it through the shader itself. When implementing the color corrections I found them too strong as they overpowered the scene even with lower intensity so I tried changing the lighting mode in the projet settings from gamma to linear making things look less plastic. I also tried using the Post Processing Stack to create a Post Process Layer to overlay on the camera. This allowed for easier implementation of a vignette which helped darken the corners of the screen and give the game a more claustrophobic feel. I was also able to more effectively adjust the color grading filter by doing so directly in the inspector itself, saving time and resources from needing to pull a LUT into photoshop. This way also allowed me to see the changes made in real time in the context of the game which made for a more efficient workflow. With this I was able to desaturate the scene to give it an eerier, more bleached out and 'dead' look to the trees and grass. Without the color correction the greens and browns popped very brightly which contrasted too much with the dark and eerie nature of the scene's atmosphere. 

# Emissive Textures - Nicholas
For the emissive textures I used 3Dcoat to paint the word "Death" on a plane and gave it emissive properties through that software. It doesn't translate as well into Unity where I learned the importance of being able to use the shaders to achieve that in Unity itself. Doing so allowed me to create the effect I wanted by having "Death" be visible from far away even while not illuminated

# Toon Shaders - Joseph
For the metallic shader, first we set the base color to a grey (#c0c0c0) using a color variable, then connect a float named smoothness
To adjust the smoothness. Ambient occlusion is set to 1 to make the light affect it more directly (shaded where the light doesn't touch it and vice versa). A float called Metallic allows us to change how metallic and reflective it is. The emissions gives it a glow effect where the light shines.

# Void Shading - Joseph
For the void shade we have a gradient noise to create a randomized pattern going into a remap to keep its values small in the calculations. And a Simple noise to produces a sine wave of flashing to the gradient noise by multiplying sin time by a float value of 0.2 to control its speed.
Both of those are then multiplied together and fed into the unlit fragment base color.

# Metallic - Joseph
For the metallic shader, first we set the base color to a grey (#c0c0c0) using a color variable, then connect a float named smoothness
To adjust the smoothness. Ambient occlusion is set to 1 to make the light affect it more directly (shaded where the light doesn't touch it and vice versa). A float called Metallic allows us to change how metallic and reflective it is. The emissions gives it a glow effect where the light shines.

# Course Project - Final Assignment 

The following are the explanations required for each new implementation along with the updates and improvements made to the assignment 1 deliverables.

# Improvement
The first big improvement we made was to remake the model for the flashlight. The original model had too much additional, unnecessary, geometry which caused some issues with the normals. Entire faces of the prop would not appear.

The image above is the original model for the flashlight.

Shown above is the updated model, with proper normals. The geometry is also cleaned up significantly.

Improvements were also made to preexisting textures.

The first was on the doors

The original door texture was very flat, lacking a normal map. It was entirely hand drawn by Nicholas. The bottom picture features our updated texture which was made in 3DCoat. A normal map was applied to add more depth to the wood planks and the metal of the frame, making the visuals much more interesting and fit in much better in an eerie world than a cartoonish hand drawn texture does. 

We made a similar change to the trees. Which, once having flat, solid colours as textures, are now complete with a more interesting texture that falls in line with the ambience of the game. It makes it easier to color grade as it isn't already made of bright colours. They feature normal maps as well.

# Texture
As previously mentioned, texturing was applied to the trees and doors. Textures were applied to every physical object in the game, with the player and the new flashlight being the only exceptions. This includes the water texture which was created using Substance Designer. I wanted to play around with the different resources that allow us to create our own textures. With 3DCoat I was afforded more precision to paint on textures directly onto the models which allowed me greater control over the look as I was able to see it applied immediately. Substance Designer allowed me to get more detailed with each attribute of the texture itself and make the normal mapping myself using the nodes. With these tools I was able to create multiple different textures in different ways and learned the value of each tool in the control it allows me. 
The blades of grass retain their original textures from Assignment 1. As do the large mountains and the grass plane the player walks on. Much of the texturing had already been completed in the first assignment, thus over 70% of the objects feature appropriate textures.

# Visual Effects
# Waves
A new addition to the scene was a small creek. We created a water shader that would not only apply waves but also featured a scrolling texture. This was a combination of two different shaders we went over in class. Combining the two allowed for a more dynamic creek as the texture moved with the waves themselves, making the illusion of downstream movement appear more convincingly. The shader was also made to be fully tileable, which allowed us to creat a creek that spans the length of the scene without needlessly stretching out the textures. The shader uses a sine function applied to each vertex of the plane to create the waves, this is why visually the waves actually look like a sine function.

# Glass

An example of the glass texture being used to create a glass door. 
the glass shader was made in shader graph by first setting the surface type to transparent, the blending mode to Alpha, and the Render Face to both, then we added a fresnal effect to give the glass a shine, we took the fresnal effect and multiplied it by a float value to change the density of the effect, then we add the base color to the multiplied result and plug that into the emissions.
we also connect float values to the smoothness, metallic and alpha fragment section to modify the properties of the glass in unity for if we want to have a more frosted effect on the glass or not


# Particles

for the fireflies we made 3 floats and a color float, those floats are an intensity float, a flickerSpeed float and an alpha float. now for the effect itself we first used a fresnal effect with the intensity float connect to its power, multiplied by the BaseColor, and then further multiplied by a sine time remaped to produces variables between 0 and 1. that remap is then multiplied by the flickerSpeed float. now we took those to results bot the Time remap and fresnal effect and multiplied them and further multiplied them with a sample texture 2D of a black circle to produce a circular shape. all of that is connected to the base color fragment and the alpha float is connected to the alpha fragment.
for the graph setting we changed the surface type to transparent, Render face to both, blending mode to additive.
now this material was used in combination with unity's Particles system to produce the FireFlies.
for the particles system settings we used the emission, shape, vekicuty over lifetime, size over lifetime, noise, and redenderer.
for emission we set the rate at which the particles spawn to 10 and added a burst to randomly add a bunch more fireflies.
for the shape we set it to a sphere to emit the particles in all directions
for the size over lifetime we set the size to a curve that is bell shaped so that the particles start smaller grow big in the lifetime then shrink back down before the end of there lifetime.
for the noise we set the strength to 1, the frequency to 0.5 and the scroll speed to a curve that is S shaped.

Another Particle System was used to add Leafs that are falling and flying about.
for the material its just a hand drawn life with a transparent background.
this material was then connected to the rendering of a particles system. for this Particle system the settings that where used are emmision, shape, noise, rotation over lifetime and redenderer.
for the emission we set the start lifetime to 10, the start size to 0.1 and its gravity modifier to 0.1. for the shape we used the box shape, for the rotation over lifetime we set the angular velocity to 45 to give it the effect that its being blown in the wind. for the noise it strength is set to 0.5 along with its frequency.
